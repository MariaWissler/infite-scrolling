This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Infinite Scrolling 

This is an inifite scrolling exercise in React, you will be able to see the cards from Magic: The Gathering featuring the kind creature, there is also a simple search by name, this is the result of calling the following API: (https://docs.magicthegathering.io/)

## How to see it ?

Please clone the project, run npm install and then npm start, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `About npm start` and CORS 

Due to CORS, use this plugin that allows you to send cross-domain requests so you are able to see the cards:

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### About the `npm dependencies` used: 

- Axios/to make our request!

- Router/always needed!
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
 npm install --save react-router-dom

  - npm install --save reactstrap react react-dom

- React Bootstrap/one is not enough!
(https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
